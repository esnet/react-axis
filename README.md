# React Axis

Getting started
---------------

This React Axis component is intended to be installed with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and the built into your project with a tool like [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). It expects React to be present, of course. This component is also used within our TimeSeries visualization library: react-timeseries-charts. You might want to check that out.

To install:

    npm install react-axis --save

Developing
----------

The repo contains the examples website. This is very helpful in developing new functionality. Within a cloned repo, you first need to run:

    npm install

This will install the development dependencies into your node_modules directory.

You can then start up the test server, as well as automatic source building, by doing:

    npm run start-website

Then, point your browser to:

[http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/](http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/)
